The Court may infer from this that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material.

### (c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge.
There were many transactions between A and B, and A had no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no defence.
The Court may infer from such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a material error.

The Court may infer from these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial.

### (e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 2023, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him for that murder) on the 21st January, Section 2023: When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the murder of Khoda Baksh.
The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh.
The Court may infer from this that A was misled, and that the error was material.

# Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita

## Section 1

Short title, commencement and application. ––

#### (1)  This Act may be called the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Section 2023: 

#### (2)  It shall come into force on such date1 as the Central Government may, by notification  in the Official Gazette, appoint, and different dates may be appointed for different provisions  of this Sanhita.  

#### (3)  Every person shall be liable to punishment under this Sanhita and not otherwise for every act or omission contrary to the provisions thereof, of which he shall be guilty within India.  

#### (4)  Any person liable, by any law for the time being in force in India , to be tried for an offence committed beyond India shall be dealt with according to the provisions of this Sanhita for any act committed beyond India in the same manner as if such act had been committed within India.  

#### (5)  The provisions of this Sanhita shall also apply to any offence committed by — (a) any citizen of India in any place without and beyond India;  (b) any person on any ship or aircraft registered in India wherever it may be;  (c) any person in any place without and beyond India committing offence targeting a computer resource located in India.
Explanation. —In this section, the word “offence ” includes every act committed outside India which, if committed in India, would be punish able under this Sanhita.
Illustration.
A, who is a citizen of India, commits a murder in any place without and beyond India.
He can be tried and convicted of murder in any place in India in which he may be found.  

#### (6)  Nothing in this Sanhita shall affect t he provisions of any Act for punishing mutiny and desertion of officers, soldiers, sailors or airmen in the service of the Government of India or the provisions of any special or local law.

## Section 2

Definitions . –– In this Sanhita, unless the context otherwise requires, –– 

#### (1)  “act” denotes as well a series of acts as a single act;  

#### (2)  “animal ” means any living creature, other than a human being;  

#### (3)  “child ” means any person below the age of eighteen years;  

#### (4)  “counterfeit ”.––A person is said to “counterfeit ” who causes one thing to resemble another thing, intending by means of that resemblance to practise deception, or knowing it to be likely that deception will thereby be practised.

## Section 3

General explanations. —

#### (1)  Throughout this Sanhita every definition of an offence, every penal provision,  and every Illustration of every such definition or penal provision, shall be understood  subject to the exceptions contained in the Chapter entitled “General Exceptions ”, though those exceptions are not repeated in such definition, penal provision, or Illustration .
Illustration s. (a) The sections in this Sanhita, which contain definitions of offences, do not express  that a child under seven years of age cannot commit such offences; but the definitions are to  be understood subject to the general exception which provides that nothing shall be an  offence which is done by a child under seven years of age.  (b) A, a police officer, without warrant, apprehends Z, who has committed  murder.
Here  A is not guilty of the offence of wrongful confinement; for he was bound by law to apprehend  Z, and therefore the case falls within the general exception which provides that “nothing is  an offence which is done by a person who is bound by law  to do it ”. 

#### (2)  Every expression which is explained in any Part of this Sanhita, is used in every Part of this Sanhita in conformity with the explanation.  

#### (3)  When property is in the possession of a person’s spouse, clerk or servant, on account of that person, it is in that person’s possession within the meaning of this Sanhita.
Explanation. —A person employed temporarily or on a particular occasion in the capacity of a clerk or servant, is a clerk or servant within the meaning of this sub -section.  

#### (4)  In e very Part of this Sanhita, except where a contrary intention appears from the context, words which refer to acts done extend also to illegal omissions.  

#### (5)  When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each o f such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.  

#### (6)  Whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge or intention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the act with such knowledge or intention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone with that knowledge or intention.  

#### (7)  Wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence.
Illustration .
A intentionally causes Z’s death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and partly by  beating Z.
A has committed murder.  

#### (8)  When an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence.
Illustration s. (a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses of poison.
A and B administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z.
Z dies from the effects the several doses of poison so administered to him.
Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate.  (b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours at a time.
A and B, intending to cause Z’s death, knowingly cooperate in causing that effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose.
Z dies of hunger.
Both A and B are guilty of the murder of Z.  (c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner.
A, intending to cause Z’s death, illegally omits to supply Z with food; in consequence of which Z is much reduced in  strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death.
A is dismissed from his office, and B succeeds him.
B, without collusion or cooperation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z’s death.
Z dies of hunger.
B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not cooperate with B.
A is guilty only of an attempt to commit murder.  

#### (9)  Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act.
Illustration .
A attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would be only culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
B, having ill -will towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject  to the provocation, assists A in killing Z.
Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z’s death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable homicide.

#### (5)  If the offence is punishable with fine or community service, the imprisonment which the Court imposes in default of payment of the fine or in default of community service shall be simple, and the term for which the Court directs the offender to be imprisoned, in default of payment of fine or in default of community service, shall not exceed, —  (a) two months when the amount of the fine does not exceed five thousand rupees;  (b) four months when the amount of the fine does not exceed ten thousand rupees; and  (c) one year  in any other case.

Illustration .
A is sentenced to a fine of one thousand rupees and to four months’ imprisonment in default of payment.
Here, if seven hundred and fifty rupees of the fine be paid or levied before the expiration of one month of the imprisonment, A will be discharged as soon as the first month has expired.
If seven hundred and fifty rupees be paid or levied at the time of the expiration of the first month, or at any later time while A continues in imprisonment, A will be immediately discharged.

#### (1)  Where anything which is an offence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with the punishment of more than one of such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided.  

#### (2)  Where — (a) anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force for the time being by which offences are defined or punished; or  (b) several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an offence, constitute, when combined, a different offence,  the offender shall not be punished with a more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could award for any one of such offences.
Illustrations . (a) A gives Z fifty strokes with a stick.
Here A may have committed the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to Z by the whole beating, and also by each of the blows which make up the whole beating.
If A were liable to punishment for every blow, he might be imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow.
But he is liable only to one punishment for the whole beating.  (b) But, if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes, and A intentionally strikes Y, here, as the blow given to Y is no part of the act whereby A voluntarily causes hurt to Z, A is liable to one punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the blow given to Y.

## Section 14

Act done by a person bound, or by mistake of fact believing himself bound, by law .—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and  not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it.

## Section 17

Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself justified, by law .—Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good  faith, believes himself to be justified by law, in doing it.
Illustration .
A sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder.
A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper authorities.

Here, if there was no want of proper caution on the part of A, his act  is excusable and not an offence.

## Section 19

Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm .—Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property.
Explanation .—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was of such a nature and so  imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm.
Illustrations . (a) A, the captain of a vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position that,  before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear.
Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run  down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down the boat C.  (b) A, in a great fire , pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading.
He does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property.
Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent as to excuse A ’s act, A is not guilty of the offence.

Act of a person of unsound m ind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.

## Section 23

Act of a person incapable o f judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will .—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong,  or contrary to law; provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.

## Section 24

Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated .—In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge  as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.

## Section 25

Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by consent .—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent, whether express or imp lied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm.
Illustration .
A and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement.
This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which, in the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence.

Illustration .
A, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation  is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint, but not intending to cause Z’s death, and intending, in good faith, Z’s benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z’s consent.
A has committed no offence.

## Section 27

Act done in good faith for benefit of child or person of unsound mind, by, or by consent of guardian .—Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or person of unsound mind, by, or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or be known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person:  Provided that this exception shall not ex tend to — (a) the intentional causing of death, or to the attempting to cause death;  (b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of  any grievous disease or infirmity;  (c) the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the attempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;  (d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not extend.

People below hold out a blanket.
A drops  the child from the house top, knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child’s benefit.
Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence.
Explanation .—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 26, 27 and this section.

But A has the same right of private defence which he would have if Z were sane.  (b) A enters by night a house  which he is legally entitled to enter.
Z, in good faith, taking A for a house -breaker, attacks A.

Illustrations . (a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a person of unsound mind to commit an act which would be  an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A.
Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence.  (b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z’s death.
B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z’s death.
Here, though B was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in  the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.  (c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling -house.
B, in consequence of his unsoundness of mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A’s instigation.

Explanation  Section 5: —It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it.
It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.
Illustration .
A concerts  with B a plan for poisoning Z.
It is agreed that A shall administer the poison.
B then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A’s name.
C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained.
A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence.
Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered.

(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house, B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of property there.
A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning.  (c) A instigates B and C to break  into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and provides them with arms for that purpose.
B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z.

Illustration .
A instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z.
B, in consequence of the instigation, causes grievous hurt to Z.
Z dies in consequence.
Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the punishment provided for murder.

## Section 54

Illustration .
A instigates B to murder Z.
The offence is not committed.
If B had murdered Z, he would have been subject to the punishment of death or imprisonment for life.

Murder .—Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, — (a) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death; or   (b) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused; or  (c) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or  (d) if the person committing the act by which the death is caused, knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodily in jury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.
Illustrations . (a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him.
Z dies in consequence.
A commits murder.  (b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury.
Z dies in consequence of the blow.
A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health.
But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.  (c) A intentionally gives Z a sword -cut or club -wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature.
Z dies in consequence.
Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z’s death.  (d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them.
A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual.
Exception  Section 1: —Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of            self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident:  Provided that the provocation is not, — (a) sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person;  (b) given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant;  (c) given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.
Explanation .—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.
Illustrations . (a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z’s child.
This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.  (b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A.
A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight.
A kills Z.
Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide.  (c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff.
A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z.
This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.  (d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate.
Z says that he does not believe a word of A’s deposition, and that A has perjured himself.
A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z.
This is murder.  (e) A attempts to pull Z’s nose.
Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so.
A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z.
This is murder, in as much as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence.  (f) Z strikes B.
B is by this provocation excited  to violent rage.
A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B’s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B’s hand for that purpose.
B kills Z with the knife.
Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.
Exception Section 2: —Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right o f defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.
Illustration .
Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A.
A draws out a pistol.
Z persists in the assault.
A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead.
A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide.
Exception  Section 3: —Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill -will towards the person whose death is caused.
Exception  Section 4: —Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender’s  having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.
Explanation. —It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault.
Exception  Section 5: —Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.
Illustration .
A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a child to commit suicide.
Here, on account of Z’s youth, he was incapable of giving con sent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder.

## Section 303

Theft .—

#### (1)  Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person’s consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft.
Explanation  Section 1: —A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth.
Explanation  Section 2: —A moving effected by the same act which affects the severance may be a theft.
Explanation  Section 3: —A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it.
Explanation  Section 4: —A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal.
Explanation  Section 5: —The consent mentioned in this section may be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession,  or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied.
Illustrations . (a) A cuts down a tree on Z’s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent.
Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.  (b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z’s dog to follow it.
Here, if A’s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent.
A has committed theft as soon as Z’s dog has begun to follow A.  (c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure.
He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure.
As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.  (d) A being Z’s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z’s plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z’s consent.
A has committed theft.  (e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return.
A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it.
Here the plate was not in Z’s possession.
It could not therefore be taken out of Z’s possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.  (f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies.
Here the ring is in Z’s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.  (g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person.
A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.  (h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’s house.
Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten.
Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.  
- (i)  A delivers his watch to Z, a jewel er, to be regulated.
Z carries it to his shop.
A, not owing to the jeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z’s hand, and carries it away.
Here A, though h e may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, in as much as what he did was not done dishonestly.    (j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes he watch out of Z’s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, in as much as he takes it dishonestly.  (k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z’s possession without Z’s  consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property in as much as he takes it dishonestly.  (l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration.
Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft.  (m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes away a book without Z’s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it.
Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z’s implied consent to use Z’s book.
If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.  (n) A asks charity from Z’s wife.
She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband.
Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z’s wife is authorised to give away alms.
If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.  (o) A is the paramour of Z’s wife.
She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give.
If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.  (p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’s own property, takes that property out of Z’s possession.
Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.  

#### (2)  Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both and in case of second or subsequent conviction of any person under this section, he shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to five years and with fine:  Provided that in cases of theft where the value of the stolen property is less than five thousand rupees, and a person is convicted for the first time, shall upon return of the value of property or restoration of the stolen proper ty, shall be punished with community service.

Facts showing existence of state of mind, or of body or bodily feeling.—Facts showing the existence of any state of mind, such as intention, knowledge, good faith, negligence, rashness, ill-will or goodwill towards any particular person, or showing the existence of any state of body or bodily feeling, are relevant, when the existence of any such state of mind or body or bodily feeling is in issue or relevant.
Explanation 1.—A fact relevant as showing the existence of a relevant state of mind must show that the state of mind exists, not generally, but in reference to the particular matter in question.
Explanation 2.—But where, upon the trial of a person accused of an offence, the previous commission by the accused of an offence is relevant within the meaning of this section, the previous conviction of such person shall also be a relevant fact. (a) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen.
It is proved that he was in possession of a particular stolen article.
The fact that, at the same time, he was in possession of many other stolen articles is relevant, as tending to show that he knew each and all of the articles of which he was in possession to be stolen. (b) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to another person a counterfeit currency which, at the time when he delivered it, he knew to be counterfeit.
The fact that, at the time of its delivery, A was possessed of a number of other pieces of counterfeit currency is relevant.
The fact that A had been previously convicted of delivering to another person as genuine a counterfeit currency knowing it to be counterfeit is relevant. (c) A sues B for damage done by a dog of B's, which B knew to be ferocious.

(e) A is accused of defaming B by publishing an imputation intended to harm the reputation of B.
The fact of previous publications by A respecting B, showing ill-will on the part of A towards B is relevant, as proving A's intention to harm B's reputation by the particular publication in question.
The facts that there was no previous quarrel between A and B, and that A repeated the matter complained of as he heard it, are relevant, as showing that A did not intend to harm the reputation of B. (f) A is sued by B for fraudulently representing to B that C was solvent, whereby B, being induced to trust C, who was insolvent, suffered loss.
The fact that, at the time when A represented C to be solvent, C was supposed to be solvent by his neighbours and by persons dealing with him, is relevant, as showing that A made the representation in good faith. (g) A is sued by B for the price of work done by B, upon a house of which A is owner, by the order of C, a contractor.
A's defence is that B's contract was with C.
The fact that A paid C for the work in question is relevant, as proving that A did, in good faith, make over to C the management of the work in question, so that C was in a position to contract with B on C's own account, and not as agent for A. (h) A is accused of the dishonest misappropriation of property which he had found, and the question is whether, when he appropriated it, he believed in good faith that the real owner could not be found.
The fact that public notice of the loss of the property had been given in the place where A was, is relevant, as showing that A did not in good faith believe that the real owner of the property could not be found.
The fact that A knew, or had reason to believe, that the notice was given fraudulently by C, who had heard of the loss of the property and wished to set up a false claim to it, is relevant, as showing that the fact that A knew of the notice did not disprove A's good faith. 
- (i)  A is charged with shooting at B with intent to kill him.
In order to show A's intent, the fact of A's having previously shot at B may be proved. (j) A is charged with sending threatening letters to B.
Threatening letters previously sent by A to B may be proved, as showing the intention of the letters. (k) The question is, whether A has been guilty of cruelty towards B, his wife.
Expressions of their feeling towards each other shortly before or after the alleged cruelty are relevant facts. (l) The question is, whether A's death was caused by poison.
Statements made by A during his illness as to his symptoms are relevant facts. (m) The question is, what was the state of A's health at the time when an assurance on his life was effected.

The fact that A on other occasions shot at B is relevant as showing his intention to shoot B.
The fact that A was in the habit of shooting at people with intent to murder them is irrelevant. (p) A is tried for a crime.
The fact that he said something indicating an intention to commit that particular crime is relevant.
The fact that he said something indicating a general disposition to commit crimes of that class is irrelevant.

## Section 13

Facts bearing on question whether act was accidental or intentional.—When there is a question whether an act was accidental or intentional, or done with a particular knowledge or intention, the fact that such act formed part of a series of similar occurrences, in each of which the person doing the act was concerned, is relevant.  (a) A is accused of burning down his house in order to obtain money for which it is insured.
The facts that A lived in several houses successively each of which he insured, in each of which a fire occurred, and after each of which fires A received payment from a different insurance company, are relevant, as tending to show that the fires were not accidental. (b) A is employed to receive money from the debtors of B.
It is A's duty to make entries in a book showing the amounts received by him.
He makes an entry showing that on a particular occasion he received less than he really did receive.

The facts that other entries made by A in the same book are false, and that the false entry is in each case in favour of A, are relevant. (c) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to B a counterfeit currency.
The question is, whether the delivery of the currency was accidental.
The facts that, soon before or soon after the delivery to B, A delivered counterfeit currency to C, D and E are relevant, as showing that the delivery to B was not accidental.

## Section 14

Existence of course of business when relevant.—When there is a question whether a particular act was done, the existence of any course of business, according to which it naturally would have been done, is a relevant fact.  (a) The question is, whether a particular letter was dispatched.
The facts that it was the ordinary course of business for all letters put in a certain place to be carried to the post, and that particular letter was put in that place are relevant. (b) The question is, whether a particular letter reached A.
The facts that it was posted in due course, and was not returned through the Return Letter Office, are relevant.
Admissions

## Section 15

Admission defined.—An admission is a statement, oral or documentary or contained in electronic form, which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact, and which is made by any of the persons, and under the circumstances, hereinafter mentioned.

## Section 16

Admission by party to proceeding or his agent.—

#### (1)  Statements made by a party to the proceeding, or by an agent to any such party, whom the Court regards, under the circumstances of the case, as expressly or impliedly authorised by him to make them, are admissions. 

#### (2)  Statements made by— 
- (i)  parties to suits suing or sued in a representative character, are not admissions, unless they were made while the party making them held that character; or 
- (ii)  (a) persons who have any proprietary or pecuniary interest in the subject matter of the proceeding, and who make the statement in their character of persons so interested; or (b) persons from whom the parties to the suit have derived their interest in the subject matter of the suit, are admissions, if they are made during the continuance of the interest of the persons making the statements.

## Section 17

Admissions by persons whose position must be proved as against party to suit.—Statements made by persons whose position or liability, it is necessary to prove as against any party to the suit, are admissions, if such statements would be relevant as against such persons in relation to such position or liability in a suit brought by or against them, and if they are made whilst the person making them occupies such position or is subject to such liability.
A undertakes to collect rents for B.
B sues A for not collecting rent due from C to B.
A denies that rent was due from C to B.
A statement by C that he owed B rent is an admission, and is a relevant fact as against A, if A denies that C did owe rent to B.

## Section 18

Admissions by persons expressly referred to by party to suit.—Statements made by persons to whom a party to the suit has expressly referred for information in reference to a matter in dispute are admissions.
The question is, whether a horse sold by A to B is sound.

C's statement is an admission.

## Section 19

Proof of admissions against persons making them, and by or on their behalf.—Admissions are relevant and may be proved as against the person who makes them, or his representative in interest; but they cannot be proved by or on behalf of the person who makes them or by his representative in interest, except in the following cases, namely:— 

#### (1)  an admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, when it is of such a nature that, if the person making it were dead, it would be relevant as between third persons under section 26; 

#### (2)  an admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, when it consists of a statement of the existence of any state of mind or body, relevant or in issue, made at or about the time when such state of mind or body existed, and is accompanied by conduct rendering its falsehood improbable; 

#### (3)  an admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, if it is relevant otherwise than as an admission. (a) The question between A and B is, whether a certain deed is or is not forged.
A affirms that it is genuine, B that it is forged.
A may prove a statement by B that the deed is genuine, and B may prove a statement by A that deed is forged; but A cannot prove a statement by himself that the deed is genuine, nor can B prove a statement by himself that the deed is forged. (b) A, the captain of a ship, is tried for casting her away.
Evidence is given to show that the ship was taken out of her proper course.
A produces a book kept by him in the ordinary course of his business showing observations alleged to have been taken by him from day to day, and indicating that the ship was not taken out of her proper course.
A may prove these statements, because they would be admissible between third parties, if he were dead, under clause (b) of section 26. (c) A is accused of a crime committed by him at Kolkata.
He produces a letter written by himself and dated at Chennai on that day, and bearing the Chennai post-mark of that day.
The statement in the date of the letter is admissible, because, if A were dead, it would be admissible under clause (b) of section 26. (d) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen.
He offers to prove that he refused to sell them below their value.
A may prove these statements, though they are admissions, because they are explanatory of conduct influenced by facts in issue. (e) A is accused of fraudulently having in his possession counterfeit currency which he knew to be counterfeit.
He offers to prove that he asked a skilful person to examine the currency as he doubted whether it was counterfeit or not, and that person did examine it and told him it was genuine.
A may prove these facts.

## Section 20

## Section 21

Admissions in civil cases when relevant.—In civil cases no admission is relevant, if it is made either upon an express condition that evidence of it is not to be given, or under circumstances from which the Court can infer that the parties agreed together that evidence of it should not be given.

## Section 22

Confession caused by inducement, threat, coercion or promise, when irrelevant in criminal proceeding.—A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding, if the making of the confession appears to the Court to have been caused by any inducement, threat, coercion or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the Court, to give the accused person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him: Provided that if the confession is made after the impression caused by any such inducement, threat, coercion or promise has, in the opinion of the Court, been fully removed, it is relevant: Provided further that if such a confession is otherwise relevant, it does not become irrelevant merely because it was made under a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a deception practised on the accused person for the purpose of obtaining it, or when he was drunk, or because it was made in answer to questions which he need not have answered, whatever may have been the form of those questions, or because he was not warned that he was not bound to make such confession, and that evidence of it might be given against him.

## Section 23

Confession to police officer.—

#### (1)  No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence. 

#### (2)  No confession made by any person while he is in the custody of a police officer, unless it is made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate shall be proved against him: Provided that when any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information received from a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much of such information, whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact discovered, may be proved.

## Section 24

Consideration of proved confession affecting person making it and others jointly under trial for same offence.—When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the Court may take into consideration such confession as against such other person as well as against the person who makes such confession.
Explanation I.—“Offence”, as used in this section, includes the abetment of, or attempt to commit, the offence.
Explanation II.—A trial of more persons than one held in the absence of the accused who has absconded or who fails to comply with a proclamation issued under section 84 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 shall be deemed to be a joint trial for the purpose of this section. (a) A and B are jointly tried for the murder of C.
It is proved that A said—“B and I murdered C”.
The Court may consider the effect of this confession as against B. (b) A is on his trial for the murder of C.
There is evidence to show that C was murdered by A and B, and that B said— “A and I murdered C”.
This statement may not be taken into consideration by the Court against A, as B is not being jointly tried.

## Section 25

Admissions not conclusive proof, but may estop.—Admissions are not conclusive proof of the matters admitted but they may operate as estoppels under the provisions hereinafter contained.

Explanation.—The obligation stated in this section continues after the professional service has ceased. (a) A, a client, says to B, an advocate— “I have committed forgery, and I wish you to defend me”.
As the defence of a man known to be guilty is not a criminal purpose, this communication is protected from disclosure. (b) A, a client, says to B, an advocate— “I wish to obtain possession of property by the use of a forged deed on which I request you to sue”.

#### (1)  When either party proposes to give evidence of any fact, the Judge may ask the party proposing to give the evidence in what manner the alleged fact, if proved, would be relevant; and the Judge shall admit the evidence if he thinks that the fact, if proved, would be relevant, and not otherwise. 

#### (2)  If the fact proposed to be proved is one of which evidence is admissible only upon proof of some other fact, such last mentioned fact must be proved before evidence is given of the fact first mentioned, unless the party undertakes to give proof of such fact, and the Court is satisfied with such undertaking. 

#### (3)  If the relevancy of one alleged fact depends upon another alleged fact being first proved, the Judge may, in his discretion, either permit evidence of the first fact to be given before the second fact is proved, or require evidence to be given of the second fact before evidence is given of the first fact. (a) It is proposed to prove a statement about a relevant fact by a person alleged to be dead, which statement is relevant under section 26.
The fact that the person is dead must be proved by the person proposing to prove the statement, before evidence is given of the statement. (b) It is proposed to prove, by a copy, the contents of a document said to be lost.
The fact that the original is lost must be proved by the person proposing to produce the copy, before the copy is produced. (c) A is accused of receiving stolen property knowing it to have been stolen.
It is proposed to prove that he denied the possession of the property.
The relevancy of the denial depends on the identity of the property.
The Court may, in its discretion, either require the property to be identified before the denial of the possession is proved, or permit the denial of the possession to be proved before the property is identified. (d) It is proposed to prove a fact A which is said to have been the cause or effect of a fact in issue.
There are several intermediate facts B, C and D which must be shown to exist before the fact A can be regarded as the cause or effect of the fact in issue.
The Court may either permit A to be proved before B, C or D is proved, or may require proof of B, C and D before permitting proof of A.

## Section 142

Examination of witnesses.—

#### (1)  The examination of a witness by the party who calls him shall be called his examination-in-chief. 

#### (2)  The examination of a witness by the adverse party shall be called his cross-examination. 

#### (3)  The examination of a witness, subsequent to the cross-examination, by the party who called him, shall be called his re-examination.

## Section 143

Order of examinations.—

#### (1)  Witnesses shall be first examined-in-chief, then (if the adverse party so desires) cross-examined, then (if the party calling him so desires) re-examined. 

#### (2)  The examination-in-chief and cross-examination must relate to relevant facts, but the cross-examination need not be confined to the facts to which the witness testified on his examination-inchief. 

#### (3)  The re-examination shall be directed to the explanation of matters referred to in cross-examination; and, if new matter is, by permission of the Court, introduced in re-examination, the adverse party may further cross-examine upon that matter.

## Section 144

Cross-examination of person called to produce a document.—A person summoned to produce a document does not become a witness by the mere fact that he produces it, and cannot be                 cross-examined unless and until he is called as a witness.

## Section 145

Witnesses to character.—Witnesses to character may be cross-examined and re-examined.

## Section 146

Leading questions.—

#### (1)  Any question suggesting the answer which the person putting it wishes or expects to receive, is called a leading question. 

#### (2)  Leading questions must not, if objected to by the adverse party, be asked in an examination-in-chief, or in a re-examination, except with the permission of the Court. 

#### (3)  The Court shall permit leading questions as to matters which are introductory or undisputed, or which have, in its opinion, been already sufficiently proved. 

#### (4)  Leading questions may be asked in cross-examination.

## Section 147

Evidence as to matters in writing.—Any witness may be asked, while under examination, whether any contract, grant or other disposition of property, as to which he is giving evidence, was not contained in a document, and if he says that it was, or if he is about to make any statement as to the contents of any document, which, in the opinion of the Court, ought to be produced, the adverse party may object to such evidence being given until such document is produced, or until facts have been proved which entitle the party who called the witness to give secondary evidence of it.
Explanation.—A witness may give oral evidence of statements made by other persons about the contents of documents if such statements are in themselves relevant facts.
The question is, whether A assaulted B.
C deposes that he heard A say to D— “B wrote a letter accusing me of theft, and I will be revenged on him”.
This statement is relevant, as showing A's motive for the assault, and evidence may be given of it, though no other evidence is given about the letter.

## Section 148

Cross-examination as to previous statements in writing.—A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to matters in question, without such writing being shown to him, or being proved; but, if it is intended to contradict him by the writing, his attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him.

## Section 149

Questions lawful in cross-examination.—When a witness is cross-examined, he may, in addition to the questions hereinbefore referred to, be asked any questions which tend— (a) to test his veracity; or (b) to discover who he is and what is his position in life; or (c) to shake his credit, by injuring his character, although the answer to such questions might tend directly or indirectly to criminate him, or might expose or tend directly or indirectly to expose him to a penalty or forfeiture: Provided that in a prosecution for an offence under section 64, section 65, section 66, section 67, section 68, section 69, section 70 or section 71 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 or for attempt to commit any such offence, where the question of consent is an issue, it shall not be permissible to adduce evidence or to put questions in the cross-examination of the victim as to the general immoral character, or previous sexual experience, of such victim with any person for proving such consent or the quality of consent.

## Section 150

When witness to be compelled to answer.—If any such question relates to a matter relevant to the suit or proceeding, the provisions of section 137 shall apply thereto.

## Section 151

Court to decide when question shall be asked and when witness compelled to                       answer.—

#### (1)  If any such question relates to a matter not relevant to the suit or proceeding, except in so far as it affects the credit of the witness by injuring his character, the Court shall decide whether or not the witness shall be compelled to answer it, and may, if it thinks fit, warn the witness that he is not obliged to answer it. 

#### (2)  In exercising its discretion, the Court shall have regard to the following considerations, namely:— (a) such questions are proper if they are of such a nature that the truth of the imputation conveyed by them would seriously affect the opinion of the Court as to the credibility of the witness on the matter to which he testifies; (b) such questions are improper if the imputation which they convey relates to matters so remote in time, or of such a character, that the truth of the imputation would not affect, or would affect in a slight degree, the opinion of the Court as to the credibility of the witness on the matter to which he testifies; (c) such questions are improper if there is a great disproportion between the importance of the imputation made against the witness's character and the importance of his evidence; (d) the Court may, if it sees fit, draw, from the witness’s refusal to answer, the inference that the answer if given would be unfavourable.

## Section 152

Question not to be asked without reasonable grounds.—No such question as is referred to in section 151 ought to be asked, unless the person asking it has reasonable grounds for thinking that the imputation which it conveys is well-founded.  (a) An advocate is instructed by another advocate that an important witness is a dacoit.
This is a reasonable ground for asking the witness whether he is a dacoit. (b) An advocate is informed by a person in Court that an important witness is a dacoit.
The informant, on being questioned by the advocate, gives satisfactory reasons for his statement.
This is a reasonable ground for asking the witness whether he is a dacoit. (c) A witness, of whom nothing whatever is known, is asked at random whether he is a dacoit.
There are here no reasonable grounds for the question. (d) A witness, of whom nothing whatever is known, being questioned as to his mode of life and means of living, gives unsatisfactory answers.
This may be a reasonable ground for asking him if he is a dacoit.

## Section 153

Procedure of Court in case of question being asked without reasonable                 grounds.—If the Court is of opinion that any such question was asked without reasonable grounds, it may, if it was asked by any advocate, report the circumstances of the case to the High Court or other authority to which such advocate is subject in the exercise of his profession.

## Section 154

Indecent and scandalous questions.—The Court may forbid any questions or inquiries which it regards as indecent or scandalous, although such questions or inquiries may have some bearing on the questions before the Court, unless they relate to facts in issue, or to matters necessary to be known in order to determine whether or not the facts in issue existed.

## Section 155

Questions intended to insult or annoy.—The Court shall forbid any question which appears to it to be intended to insult or annoy, or which, though proper in itself, appears to the Court needlessly offensive in form.

## Section 156

Exclusion of evidence to contradict answers to questions testing veracity.—When a witness has been asked and has answered any question which is relevant to the inquiry only in so far as it tends to shake his credit by injuring his character, no evidence shall be given to contradict him; but, if he answers falsely, he may afterwards be charged with giving false evidence.
Exception 1.—If a witness is asked whether he has been previously convicted of any crime and denies it, evidence may be given of his previous conviction.
Exception 2.—If a witness is asked any question tending to impeach his impartiality, and answers it by denying the facts suggested, he may be contradicted. (a) A claim against an underwriter is resisted on the ground of fraud.
The claimant is asked whether, in a former transaction, he had not made a fraudulent claim.
He denies it.
Evidence is offered to show that he did make such a claim.
The evidence is inadmissible. (b) A witness is asked whether he was not dismissed from a situation for dishonesty.
He denies it.
Evidence is offered to show that he was dismissed for dishonesty.
The evidence is not admissible. (c) A affirms that on a certain day he saw B at Goa.
A is asked whether he himself was not on that day at Varanasi.
He denies it.
Evidence is offered to show that A was on that day at Varanasi.
The evidence is admissible, not as contradicting A on a fact which affects his credit, but as contradicting the alleged fact that B was seen on the day in question in Goa.
In each of these cases, the witness might, if his denial was false, be charged with giving false evidence. (d) A is asked whether his family has not had a blood feud with the family of B against whom he gives evidence.
He denies it.
He may be contradicted on the ground that the question tends to impeach his impartiality.

## Section 157

Question by party to his own witness.—

#### (1)  The Court may, in its discretion, permit the person who calls a witness to put any question to him which might be put in cross-examination by the adverse party. 

#### (2)  Nothing in this section shall disentitle the person so permitted under sub-section 

#### (1) , to rely on any part of the evidence of such witness.

## Section 158

Impeaching credit of witness.—The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party, or, with the consent of the Court, by the party who calls him— (a) by the evidence of persons who testify that they, from their knowledge of the witness, believe him to be unworthy of credit; (b) by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has accepted the offer of a bribe, or has received any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence; (c) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted.
Explanation.—A witness declaring another witness to be unworthy of credit may not, upon his examination-in-chief, give reasons for his belief, but he may be asked his reasons in cross-examination, and the answers which he gives cannot be contradicted, though, if they are false, he may afterwards be charged with giving false evidence. (a) A sues B for the price of goods sold and delivered to B.
C says that he delivered the goods to B.
Evidence is offered to show that, on a previous occasion, he said that he had not delivered goods to B.
The evidence is admissible. (b) A is accused of the murder of B.
C says that B, when dying, declared that A had given B the wound of which he died.
Evidence is offered to show that, on a previous occasion, C said that B, when dying, did not declare that A had given B the wound of which he died.
The evidence is admissible.

## Section 159

Questions tending to corroborate evidence of relevant fact, admissible.—When a witness whom it is intended to corroborate gives evidence of any relevant fact, he may be questioned as to any other circumstances which he observed at or near to the time or place at which such relevant fact occurred, if the Court is of opinion that such circumstances, if proved, would corroborate the testimony of the witness as to the relevant fact which he testifies.
A, an accomplice, gives an account of a robbery in which he took part.
He describes various incidents unconnected with the robbery which occurred on his way to and from the place where it was committed.
Independent evidence of these facts may be given in order to corroborate his evidence as to the robbery itself.

## Section 160

Former statements of witness may be proved to corroborate later testimony as to same fact.—In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness relating to the same fact, at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.

## Section 161

What matters may be proved in connection with proved statement relevant under section 26 or 27.—Whenever any statement, relevant under section 26 or 27, is proved, all matters may be proved either in order to contradict or to corroborate it, or in order to impeach or confirm the credit of the person by whom it was made, which might have been proved if that person had been called as a witness and had denied upon cross-examination the truth of the matter suggested.

## Section 162

Refreshing memory.—

#### (1)  A witness may, while under examination, refresh his memory by referring to any writing made by himself at the time of the transaction concerning which he is questioned, or so soon afterwards that the Court considers it likely that the transaction was at that time fresh in his memory: Provided that the witness may also refer to any such writing made by any other person, and read by the witness within the time aforesaid, if when he read it, he knew it to be correct. 

#### (2)  Whenever a witness may refresh his memory by reference to any document, he may, with the permission of the Court, refer to a copy of such document: Provided that the Court be satisfied that there is sufficient reason for the non-production of the original: Provided further that an expert may refresh his memory by reference to professional treatises.

## Section 163

Testimony to facts stated in document mentioned in section 162.—A witness may also testify to facts mentioned in any such document as is mentioned in section 162, although he has no specific recollection of the facts themselves, if he is sure that the facts were correctly recorded in the document.
A book-keeper may testify to facts recorded by him in books regularly kept in the course of business, if he knows that the books were correctly kept, although he has forgotten the particular transactions entered.

## Section 164

Right of adverse party as to writing used to refresh memory.—Any writing referred to under the provisions of the two last preceding sections shall be produced and shown to the adverse party if he requires it; such party may, if he pleases, cross-examine the witness thereupon.

## Section 165

Production of documents.—

#### (1)  A witness summoned to produce a document shall, if it is in his possession or power, bring it to Court, notwithstanding any objection which there may be to its production or to its admissibility: Provided that the validity of any such objection shall be decided on by the Court. 

#### (2)  The Court, if it sees fit, may inspect the document, unless it refers to matters of State, or take other evidence to enable it to determine on its admissibility. 

#### (3)  If for such a purpose it is necessary to cause any document to be translated, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the translator to keep the contents secret, unless the document is to be given in evidence and, if the interpreter disobeys such direction, he shall be held to have committed an offence under section 198 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023: Provided that no Court shall require any communication between the Ministers and the President of India to be produced before it.

## Section 166

Giving, as evidence, of document called for and produced on notice.—When a party calls for a document which he has given the other party notice to produce, and such document is produced and inspected by the party calling for its production, he is bound to give it as evidence if the party producing it requires him to do so.

## Section 167

Using, as evidence, of document production of which was refused on                     notice.— When a party refuses to produce a document which he has had notice to produce, he cannot afterwards use the document as evidence without the consent of the other party or the order of the Court.
A sues B on an agreement and gives B notice to produce it.
At the trial, A calls for the document and B refuses to produce it.
A gives secondary evidence of its contents.
B seeks to produce the document itself to contradict the secondary evidence given by A, or in order to show that the agreement is not stamped.
He cannot do so.

## Section 168

Judge’s power to put questions or order production.—The Judge may, in order to discover or obtain proof of relevant facts, ask any question he considers necessary, in any form, at any time, of any witness, or of the parties about any fact; and may order the production of any document or thing; and neither the parties nor their representatives shall be entitled to make any objection to any such question or order, nor, without the leave of the Court, to cross-examine any witness upon any answer given in reply to any such question: Provided that the judgment must be based upon facts declared by this Adhiniyam to be relevant, and duly proved: Provided further that this section shall not authorise any Judge to compel any witness to answer any question, or to produce any document which such witness would be entitled to refuse to answer or produce under sections 127 to 136, both inclusive, if the question were asked or the document were called for by the adverse party; nor shall the Judge ask any question which it would be improper for any other person to ask under section 151 or 152; nor shall he dispense with primary evidence of any document, except in the cases hereinbefore excepted.

## Section 169

No new trial for improper admission or rejection of evidence.—The improper admission or rejection of evidence shall not be ground of itself for a new trial or reversal of any decision in any case, if it shall appear to the Court before which such objection is raised that, independently of the evidence objected to and admitted, there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision, or that, if the rejected evidence had been received, it ought not to have varied the decision.

## Section 170

Repeal and savings.—

#### (1)  The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872) is hereby repealed. 

#### (2)  Notwithstanding such repeal, if, immediately before the date on which this Adhiniyam comes into force, there is any application, trial, inquiry, investigation, proceeding or appeal pending, then, such application, trial, inquiry, investigation, proceeding or appeal shall be dealt with under the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872), as in force immediately before such commencement, as if this Adhiniyam had not come into force.
